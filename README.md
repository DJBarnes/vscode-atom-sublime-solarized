# Atom's Solarized

## Solarized for VS Code
Solarized is a color scheme created by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
This version of Solarized is based on the version that comes with the [Atom](https://atom.io) Editor.

The base themes that were used to build this theme came from the following existing themes.

[VSCode Solarized](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-solarized-dark) that comes with the VS Code editor.

[Textmate Solarized](https://github.com/deplorableword/textmate-solarized) which provides a textmate version of the solarized theme.
